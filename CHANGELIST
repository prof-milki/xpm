0.4.0 (???)
  - Complete rewrite of pretty much everything.
    * Otherwise, the 'fpm' command functionality should be the same
    * Please let me know if something broke!
  - Now has an API (see examples/api directory)
  - Also has a proper test suite
  - Add --license and --vendor settings (via Pieter Loubser)
  - python support: try to name python packages sanely. Some pypi packages
    are literally called 'python-foo' so make sure we generate packages named
    'python-foo' and not 'python-python-foo' (via Thomas Meson)
  - rpm support: Add --rpm-rpmbuild-define for passing a --define flag to rpmbuild
    (via Naresh V)
  - PHP pear source support (fpm -s pear ...) (via Andrew Gaffney)
  TODO(sissel): pull/163, make sure --post-process is supported

0.3.10 (Oct 10, 2011)
  - Allow taking a list of files/inputs on stdin with '-' or with the --inputs
    flag. (Matt Patterson)
  - (python) pass -U to easy_install (Khalid Goudeaux)
  - (debian) quote paths in md5sum calls (Matt Patterson)
  - (debian) quiet stderr from dpkg --print-architecture

0.3.9 (Sep 8, 2011)
  - Fix bug in 'dir' source that breaks full paths
  - Added a bunch of tests (yaay)

0.3.8 and earlier: I have not kept this file up to date very well... Sorry :(

0.2.29 (May 20, 2011)
  - Add 'tar' source support. Useful for binary releases to repackage as rpms
    and debs. Example:
      fpm -s tar -t rpm -n firefox -v 4.0.1 \
        --prefix /opt/firefox/4.0.1 firefox-4.0.1.tar.bz2

0.2.28 (May 18, 2011)
  - Use --replaces as "Obsoletes" in rpms.

0.2.27 (May 18, 2011)
  - If present, DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME environment variables will be used as
    the default maintainer. Previously the default was simply <$user@$hostname>
    https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/issues/37
  - Add '--replaces' flag for specifying packages replaced by the one you are
    building. This only functions in .deb packages now until I find a suitable
    synonym in RPM.
  - Add --python-bin and --python-easyinstall flags. This lets you choose specific
    python and easy_install tools to use when building. Default is simply
    'python' and 'easy_install' respectively.
  - Add support for ~/.fpmrc - The format of this file is the same as the flags.
    One flag per line. https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/issues/38
    Example:
      --python-bin=/usr/bin/python2.7
      --python-easyinstall=/usr/bin/easy_install2.7

0.2.26 and earlier
  No changelist tracked. My bad, yo.
