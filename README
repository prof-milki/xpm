Package maintainers work hard.

Sometimes they do it wrong (because you can't do it right for all situations), but small tweaks can fix it.

That's what this tool is for.

* Creating packages easily (deb, rpm, etc)
* Tweaking existing packages (removing files, changing metadata/dependencies)
* Stripping pre/post/maintainer scripts from packages

First target:

* .deb packages. Create + modify.

Want:

* Turn .gem into .deb
* Turn npm into .deb
etc...
